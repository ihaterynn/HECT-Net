## 📌 Overview

**Snackly** is a lightweight AI-powered mobile app that recognizes Malaysian food items from images and estimates their nutritional values. It uses a hybrid deep learning model called **HECTNet**, inspired by EHFRNet, and combines both semantic and handcrafted features for robust classification in real-world conditions.

This project is designed to support health-conscious users in their dietary tracking journey and is especially useful in local contexts with food like **Nasi Lemak**, **Roti Canai**, **Satay**, etc.

## 🧠 HECTNet – Hybrid Efficient CNN-Transformer Network

HECTNet is a custom-built model tailored for mobile-friendly food recognition. It consists of:

- **Main Branch**:
  - **Backbone**: MobileNetV2 + LP-ViT (Location-Preserving ViT)
  - Extracts **semantic** global context from food images
- **Auxiliary Branch**:
  - Gabor-based handcrafted texture features across multiple scales
  - Captures **fine-grained** color and texture variations (crispy, saucy, etc.)
- **Bidirectional Cross-Attention Fusion** ("Aha! Moment"):
  - Aligns and fuses the two distinct feature types
  - Allows dynamic, context-aware feature prioritization
- **Classifier**:
  - Final fused vector (160D) passed into a fully connected layer → softmax prediction

> 💡 **“Aha! Moment”** is the coined term describing the model’s critical moment of insight during fusion—where it contextually understands which food-identifying cues matter most.

## 📌 Key Technical Innovations

### ✅ Bidirectional Cross-Attention Fusion
- Mutual interaction between main (CNN-ViT) and auxiliary (handcrafted) embeddings
- Achieves better feature complementarity

### ✅ High Performance on Challenging Datasets
- Robust to:
  - High intra-class variation (e.g., nasi lemak with/without egg)
  - Low inter-class distinctiveness (e.g., fried rice vs. nasi lemak)

### ✅ Dual Embedding Use
- Final fused 160D vector is also suitable for:
  - Visual search (content-based image retrieval)
  - Similar food recommendation
